Lwan Web Server
===============

Lwan is a **high-performance** & **scalable** web server for glibc/Linux
platforms.

The [project web site](https://lwan.ws/) contains more details.

Building
--------

Before installing Lwan, ensure all dependencies are installed. All of them
are common dependencies found in any GNU/Linux distribution; package names
will be different, but it shouldn't be difficult to search using whatever
package management tool that's used by your distribution.

### Required dependencies

 - [CMake](https://cmake.org/), at least version 2.8
 - [ZLib](http://zlib.net)

### Optional dependencies

The build system will look for these libraries and enable/link if available.

 - [Lua 5.1](http://www.lua.org) or [LuaJIT 2.0](http://luajit.org)
 - [TCMalloc](https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools)
 - [jemalloc](http://jemalloc.net/)
 - [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org)
 - To run test suite:
    - [Python](https://www.python.org/) (2.6+) with Requests
    - [Lua 5.1](http://www.lua.org)
 - To run benchmark:
    - Special version of [Weighttp](https://github.com/lpereira/weighttp)
    - [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)
 - To build TechEmpower benchmark suite:
    - Client libraries for either [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com) or [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org)
    - [SQLite 3](http://sqlite.org)


### Common operating system package names

#### Minimum to build
 - ArchLinux: `pacman -S cmake zlib`
 - FreeBSD: `pkg install cmake pkgconf`
 - Ubuntu 14+: `apt-get update && apt-get install git cmake zlib1g-dev pkg-config`

#### Build all examples
 - ArchLinux: `pacman -S cmake zlib sqlite luajit libmariadbclient gperftools valgrind`
 - FreeBSD: `pkg install cmake pkgconf sqlite3 lua51`
 - Ubuntu 14+: `apt-get update && apt-get install git cmake zlib1g-dev pkg-config lua5.1-dev libsqlite3-dev libmysqlclient-dev`

### Build commands

#### Clone the repository

    ~$ git clone git://github.com/lpereira/lwan
    ~$ cd lwan

#### Create the build directory

    ~/lwan$ mkdir build
    ~/lwan$ cd build

#### Select build type

Selecting a *release* version (no debugging symbols, messages, enable some
optimizations, etc):

    ~/lwan/build$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

If you'd like to enable optimiations but still use a debugger, use this instead:

    ~/lwan/build$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo

To disable optimizations and build a more debugging-friendly version:

    ~/lwan/build$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

#### Build Lwan

    ~/lwan/build$ make

This will generate a few binaries:

 - `src/bin/lwan/lwan`: The main Lwan executable. May be executed with `--help` for guidance.
 - `src/bin/testrunner/testrunner`: Contains code to execute the test suite.
 - `src/samples/freegeoip/freegeoip`: FreeGeoIP sample implementation. Requires SQLite.
 - `src/samples/techempower/techempower`: Code for the Techempower Web Framework benchmark. Requires SQLite and MySQL libraries.
 - `src/bin/tools/mimegen`: Builds the extension-MIME type table. Used during build process.
 - `src/bin/tools/bin2hex`: Generates a C file from a binary file, suitable for use with #include.

#### Remarks

Passing `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` will enable some compiler
optimizations (such as [LTO](http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/LinkTimeOptimization))
and tune the code for current architecture. *Please use this version
when benchmarking*, as the default is the Debug build, which not only
logs all requests to the standard output, but does so while holding a
mutex.

The default build (i.e. not passing `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`) will build
a version suitable for debugging purposes.  This version can be used under
Valgrind *(if its headers are present)*, is built with Undefined Behavior
Sanitizer, and includes debugging messages that are stripped in the release
version.  Debugging messages are printed for each and every request.

Which sanitizer will be used in a debug build can be selected by passing the
following arguments to the CMake invocation line:

 - `-DSANITIZER=ubsan` selects the Undefined Behavior Sanitizer.
 - `-DSANITIZER=address` selects the Address Sanitizer.
 - `-DSANITIZER=thread` selects the Thread Sanitizer.

### Tests

    ~/lwan/build$ make teststuite

This will compile the `testrunner` program and execute regression test suite
in `src/scripts/testsuite.py`.

### Benchmark

    ~/lwan/build$ make benchmark

This will compile `testrunner` and execute benchmark script
`src/scripts/benchmark.py`.

### Coverage

Lwan can also be built with the Coverage build type by specifying
`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Coverage`.  This enables the `generate-coverage` make
target, which will run `testrunner` to prepare a test coverage report with
[lcov](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php).

Every commit in this repository triggers the generation of this report,
and results are [publicly available](https://buildbot.lwan.ws/lcov/).

Running
-------

Set up the server by editing the provided `lwan.conf`; the format is
very simple and should be self-explanatory.

Configuration files are loaded from the current directory. If no changes
are made to this file, running Lwan will serve static files located in
the `./wwwroot` directory. Lwan will listen on port 8080 on all interfaces.

Lwan will detect the number of CPUs, will increase the maximum number of
open file descriptors and generally try its best to autodetect reasonable
settings for the environment it's running on.

Optionally, the `lwan` binary can be used for one-shot static file serving
without any configuration file. Run it with `--help` for help on that.

Portability
-----------

While Lwan was written originally for Linux, it has been ported to BSD
systems as well.  The build system will detect the supported features
and build support library functions as appropriate.

For instance, [epoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoll) has been
implemented on top of [kqueue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kqueue), and
Linux-only syscalls and GNU extensions have been implemented for the
supported systems.

Performance
-----------

It can achieve good performance, yielding about **320000 requests/second**
on a Core i7 laptop for requests without disk access, and without pipelining.

When disk I/O is required, for files up to 16KiB, it yields about
**290000 requests/second**; for larger files, this drops to **185000
requests/second**, which isn't too shabby either.

These results, of course, with keep-alive connections, and with weighttp
running on the same machine (and thus using resources that could be used
for the webserver itself).

Without keep-alive, these numbers drop around 6-fold.

IRC Channel
-----------

There is an IRC channel (`#lwan`) on [Freenode](http://freenode.net). A
standard IRC client can be used.  A [web IRC gateway](http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=%23lwan&uio=d4)
is also available.
